        <h3>Welcome! </h3>
        <p>
        This is a visual blog of movie / pop culture art that I find online. For one reason or another, these pieces bring back great nostalgic memories that I have tried to log in the respective description. I am not affiliated with any of these works and have provided links to the artist that created them (if you want more information). I would describe my taste, as a 80s / 90s kid that  never really grew up..
        <br>
        <br>
        Most of these pieces were printed in a limited run and usually sold out within seconds of their online release, so enjoy the art and stories behind them!
